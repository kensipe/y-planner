# Plans
## mission:
1. center of all projects... lists wiki, vcs, all setup info
2. automates admin of users --> vcs, bug control, adds user to project announcements
3. accessible from eclipse, idea, iphone, droid

## musts:
1. wizard a project setup
2. what am i working on
3. iteration burn down ( from mobile)
4. steal a task
5. keyboard editable
6. integration.. REST
7. deployable war, + standalone version, + automatic up to file system unless configured otherwise
8. ical format, gcal, send out open / uat / closing meetings
9. connect to basecamp... provide basecamp like forum on a story and project
10. connect to basamiq (mocking) .. for story
11. rss feed on project and story (atom)
12. atlassian jira, cruciable, code viewer
13. run code run

## notes
	* project setup
		1. number of iterations
		2. iteration 0 ?
		3. set of stories... 
		4. people assignment + admins + notification + yahoo
		5. twitter, notification (announce)
		6. hudson location
		7. version code location
			(consider credentials for # 6/7... setup a person should automate the rest )
		8. bug tracker / wiki
	* stories
		1. set for project
		2. backlog
		3. set for each iteration
		project setup -> release plan
	- history of pairing... (hmmm)

## centricity
	1. projects - project health, project help, current iteration, iteration timelines, burndown, 
	2. users - administration, who's working on what,
	3. iteration - velocity, burndown
	4. stories - all, backlog, discovered, planned, developer, tasks, creation (a story always belongs to a project... it should know if it is on an iteration or in the backlog, it needs to be able to split for a carry over)
	5. company / entity -> has people / people management, has projects (MSP Pool features)
	
## ideas
 * perhaps mongodb or cassandra storage for project info and make it extensible ( this might restrict adoption to enterprise), useful if hosted solution
 * perhaps a google app engine version
